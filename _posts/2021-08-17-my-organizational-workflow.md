Mostly a test post and hopefully I'll update this later. I want to document how my organization evolves as I begin my graduate research.

Lately I've been trying to figure out the best way to keep information organized. I find that I look over a lot of papers, some of them are highly relevant and easy to keep track of, but many of them are not fully relevant, but I still want to keep track of them somehow. They could become relevant some day, or I might suddenly think 'hey what was that one paper I looked at', then never be able to find the paper again.

I still haven't worked out a good method of tracking things, but I'll document my current workflow here and hopefully it evolves over time to be more efficient. I'll also document past things I tried and why I didn't like them.

Reference Managers
======
Personally, I use [Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/) as my lab has a subscription. In the past I've also used [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and briefly tested out [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/).

They're good for reading and marking up papers, but not as much for synthesizing overviews of groups of papers. While it is possible to group papers in folders, it doesn't feel like enough. I probably need to take more time to better organize these folders, though.

Note Organizers
======

Google Docs
------
I'd say the major strengths of Google Docs are the document structure view that allows you to easily jump between sections, the ability to have folders within folders when organizing documents, and the (albeit kind of clunky) support for LaTeX equations with the [Auto-LaTeX Equations](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/autolatex_equations/850293439076) add-on. I still use Google Docs for a lot of things. I guess some cons are that you can end up with a lot of tabs open, and I don't always like that you can't have one long document with no separations, things are always split into pages (even if you change the view so there's no space between pages, it's still a little clunky).

Obsidian
------
I've been testing out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for a while. I really like the graph view, that all documents are written in Markdown, that LaTeX equations are supported, and that everything is stored locally. I think there's a lot you can do with it as well, if you take the time to learn the ins and outs of everything. I started organizing relevant papers as a graph where each paper has links to other relevant papers and topics. I have other types of notes as well, on things like programming languages and other frameworks I use. I think it's quite a powerful tool for visualizing how things fit together. Writing in Markdown is really nice as well. It costs money to automatically sync between devices, but since your Obsidian vault is just a folder on your computer, I simply created a GitHub repo so I can sync between different computers. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txsScSC53-8) is a video that inspired how I set up my vault.

Notion
------
I experimented with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for a while last summer. I worked on a project with another student, and we used a table in Notion to track all the references we were maintaining for a paper. I think spreadsheets/tables are quite nice for visualizing references better. I think it's because there's a lot more freedom to how you arrange things, and freedom for what columns you have. I haven't used it for a while, but I do think I will try it out again. The tables are a major strength of Notion, and there's a lot of existing templates I believe for making very aesthetically pleasing documents. I think I also got a free subscription for being a student. Now that I write this, I really want to go back to Notion. It's also good for To Do lists I think, overall I think it has a lot of benefits for project organization.

Evernote
------
The cons of [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/) are no LaTeX, can't have folders within folders. That being said, I really like the way you can view documents though, it's nice having everything in one tab and no pages separating content. I think it's much nicer to traverse than Google Docs, it's definitely a nice way to organize lots of notes. I believe there's also more support for embedding content into the notes, for example audio clips and videos. You can also create 'tasks' which allow you to create To Do lists and set due dates, but that feature isn't free.

Overleaf
------
I use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) quite a bit for creating documents with LaTeX. For math courses in undergrad I'd often write all my notes into one big document, and I think that worked well. I also use it for making presentations with Beamer, I think it's been really worthwhile getting used to using packages like TikZ. For research, I have a LaTeX document with sections for papers I think are most central to what I think my future research might be. My hope is that this can serve as my future 'related works' analysis. So far the document just consists of paper titles, but I hope to expand it with information on each paper, and hopefully some high level synthesizes that ties everything together.
