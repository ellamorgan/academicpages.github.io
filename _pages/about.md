I'm a Master's student in Computing at Queen's University, where I'm a part of the [MuLab](http://mulab.ai) and supervised by Dr. Christian Muise. My Undergraduate degree was in Computer Science and Mathematics at Trent University. My love for problem solving is what drew me to both computer science and math, and led me to pursuing research in machine learning. My favourite aspects are researching problems, learning new techniques, and implementing the solutions. I'm currently looking for my first industry role, I'm excited for all the new problems I'll be able to approach and the opportunity to learn even more!
