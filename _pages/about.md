I'm a Master's student in computing in the [MuLab](https://mulab.ai) at Queen's University. My research is motivated by how we can align predictions from 
deep learning models with a given underlying structure of the world, combining learning from data with exploiting prior information on how the environment should behave.

My undergraduate degree was in computer science and mathematics at Trent University. My love for problem solving is what drew me to both computer science and math, and led me to pursuing research in machine learning. My favourite aspects are researching problems, learning new techniques, and implementing the solutions. I'm currently looking for my first industry role, I'm excited for all the new problems I'll get to approach and the opportunity to continue learning!
