My personal website is still under development. Here I will post projects I've worked on, and possibly write short blog entries on things that interest me or information I found helpful.

I will be joining the [MuLab](http://mulab.ai) at Queen's University in September 2021 as a Master's student. My research interests lie in neuro-symbolic methods and automated planning.
