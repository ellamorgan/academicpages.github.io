I'm a Master's student in computing in the [MuLab](mulab.ai) at Queen's University. My research is motivated by how we can identify when two states are the same based on their underlying properties, even when they appear different visually. I'm using deep learning techniques including contrastive learning to investigate this problem, and am creating a custom dataset that randomly generates states from PDDL domain and problem files to test on.

My undergraduate degree was in computer science and mathematics at Trent University. My love for problem solving is what drew me to both computer science and math, and led me to pursuing research in machine learning. My favourite aspects are researching problems, learning new techniques, and implementing the solutions. I'm currently looking for my first industry role, I'm excited for all the new problems I'll get to approach and the opportunity to continue learning!
