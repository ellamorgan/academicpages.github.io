I'm a Master's student in Computing at Queen's University, where I'm a part of the [MuLab](http://mulab.ai) and supervised by Dr. Christian Muise. My research is motivated by how we can learn an underlying symbolic model from noisy observations. To this end, I am currently working towards learning encodings of states that have been generated with visual differences, in a manner that learns when states have the same underlying 'meaning' despite visually appearing to be different.

My Undergraduate degree was in Computer Science and Mathematics at Trent University. My love for problem solving is what drew me to both computer science and math, and led me to pursuing research in machine learning. My favourite aspects are researching problems, learning new techniques, and implementing the solutions. I'm currently looking for my first industry role, I'm excited for all the new problems I'll get to approach and the opportunity to continue learning!
