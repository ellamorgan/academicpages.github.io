I'm a Master's student in computing in the [MuLab](https://mulab.ai) at Queen's University. My research is motivated by how we can align predictions of images from deep learning models with a given underlying structure of the world, combining data-driven learning with prior information on how the environment should behave.

My undergraduate degree was in computer science and mathematics at Trent University. My love for problem solving is what drew me to both computer science and math, and led me to pursuing research in machine learning. I find the process of researching problems, learning new techniques, and implementing solutions incredibly rewarding. 

I'm currently looking for my first industry role. I look forward to the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge, and I'm excited to tackle new challenges and continue to learn and grow.
