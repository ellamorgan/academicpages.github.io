I'm a Master's student in Computing at Queen's University, where I'm a part of [MuLab](http://mulab.ai) and supervised by Dr. Christian Muise. My interests lie in neuro-symbolic methods and automated planning, specifically in unsupervised model acquisiton for planning. My current work is mainly related to evaluating the quality of representations learned by discrete world models.
