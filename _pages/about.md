My personal website is still under development. Here I will post projects I've worked on, and possibly write short blog entries on things that interest me or information I found helpful. We'll see, though.

My research interests lie in neuro-symbolic methods and automated planning, and I will hopefully be doing research in this area when I start my Master's at Queen's this September 2021.

This summer I've been evaluating the latent representation of a fully discretized DreamerV2, a model-based RL agent that can play Atari games. I'm aiming to post information on this project and previous research projects I've worked on in the 'Research Projects' section of this website at some point.
