A rook polynomial is a generating function for the number of arrangements of objects where each object has a set of restricted positions. This problem is visualized as placing *n* non-capturing rooks on a chessboard (i.e. no two rooks are in the same row or column), where some squares of the board are darkened to represent restricted positions that rooks cannot be placed on.
